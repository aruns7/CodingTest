The test was started at 4.40 and final submission around 5:55

Approach:
After recieving the requirement I spent a little time thinking and producing a design.
It's very simple with a factory method in WidgetMachine, which is loosely coupled to an Engine interface
I then spent a fair amount of the allocated time refactoring after initial tests were implemented. Further tests and code was developed.
ToDo
Create fuel abstractions, which encapsulates fuel details. Currently engines are exposed to these details.
Create batch abstractions and optimise the produce calculation utilising BigDecimal.
